"# AdminPortal" </br>
This project is an online banking system that consists of two parts: User-Front and Admin-Portal. User-front is a user-facing system and it includes modules such as User Signup/Login, Account Transfer, Transactions, Appointment. and Admin Portal includes User Account and Appointment modules.</br></br>
For the User-front module, I have implemented Spring Security for authentication and authorization and Rest Web services to generate JSON data that can be consumed by the front end.</br></br>
And for the Admin module, I have implemented it using Angular 4 and worked on Angular Observables to fetch the data from the Rest API and display it to the admin.</br></br>
